Purpose

The purpose of this standard operating procedure is to establish a guideline for the execution of all scripts involved in the processing of metagenomics samples with the EukDetect tool.

Application

Reproduce as much as possible the analysis procedure with the EukDetect tool to facilitate processing by other users.

Procedure steps

1. Execution of EukDetect.batch that calls the program generate_configfile.py to create the configfile.

	- First of all, in this script you have to set the parameters to use garnatxa.

	- Then set the parameters and paths to be entered in the generate_configfile.py program.

	- Next, you have to provide the path to the rules/eukdetect.rules file, needed to specify the execution mode, in this case the runall. The use of snakemake is due to the fact that it is the recommended
	method for working in a cluster. 

	- Finally, enter the path where the configfile was saved.

2. Execution of pres-abs_matrix_and_taxonomy.batch which calls the pres-abs_matrix_and_taxonomy.py program to create the final presence-absence and taxonomy tables for the identified eukaryotic organisms.

	- As in the previous script, you have to configure the parameters to use garnatxa.

	- Finally, set the parameters and paths to be entered in the abs_matrix_and_taxonomy.py program.

3. The execution in garnatxa must be done in the order described above, using the command to launch the batch scripts.
